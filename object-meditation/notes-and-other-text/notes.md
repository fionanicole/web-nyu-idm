- my Home

### What does my object look like?
- an old book with a gold pegasus on the front cover that is falling apart. i had repaired the binding myself with a cut up t-shirt

### Feel like?
- the texture of the book is soft from being held and flipped through so many times

### Sound like?
- it has a very solid sound, but slightly hollow because of its hardcover

### Smell like?
- it has an old book smell but slightly spicier than ones in libraries. maybe its due to the glue used to bind it or the ink used to print it

### Where did you get it?
- my mom gave it to me when I was little, she had read it in college. the year my book copy was published is unknown, but the original book was published in 1942. it could be a 1942 copy if my mom had gotten it at an old book store, i'll have to ask her later.

### What are the emotions attached to this object for you?
- this book gives me a lot of nostalgia because it is one of the first books I ever read. it was a hard read, but i've read it so many times that it was much easier for me to read classical literature when I was little. i especially love the stories about the romances in greek mythology, my favorite being the myth of Eros and Psyche. this book also reminds me of my mom and helps with my homesickness.

### Why did you choose it?
- this is one of the more interesting objects I own since it really encapsulates why I love mythology and why i started studying it in the first place.

### What do you see in your object that no one else would see?
- I see my whole childhood in this book. it is part of the reason why I started reading and writing fiction and creating art in the first place.

### Is it one of a kind?
- it is one of a kind to me, despite being a reproduction of a book that was already published because I have had to make repairs to the spine myself when it fell apart.

### How do you interact with it?
- i read it and flip through the pages

### What are some other object it does or might have relationship with?
- it has a connection with my old notebooks and sketchbooks as well as the harry potter book series which I share a similar connection with
